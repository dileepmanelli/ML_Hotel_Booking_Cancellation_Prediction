# Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Prediction

This repository contains the code for a Machine Learning model that predicts hotel booking cancellations. The dataset used for this project is sourced from a hotel booking dataset available on Kaggle. The project is structured as follows:

# 1. Data Reading and Cleaning
The initial steps involve reading the dataset and performing necessary data cleaning. This includes handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and addressing instances where the combination of adults, children, and babies is zero.

# 2. Spatial Analysis
An analysis of where guests come from is performed. This spatial analysis includes visualizations of the countries from which guests make bookings. The dataset is filtered to include only non-canceled bookings for this analysis.

# 3. Room Pricing Analysis
A study of how much guests pay for a room per night is conducted. This analysis provides insights into the pricing patterns in the dataset.

# 4. Busiest Month Analysis
The dataset is explored to identify the busiest months in terms of hotel bookings.

# 5. Average Daily Rate (ADR) Analysis
An analysis is conducted to identify which month has the highest Average Daily Rate (ADR), providing insights into pricing trends over the months.

# 6. Weekday and Weekend Bookings Analysis
The dataset is analyzed to understand whether bookings are made predominantly for weekdays, weekends, or both.

# 7. Feature Engineering
New features are created to enhance the dataset and potentially improve model performance.

# 8. Feature Encoding
Categorical variables are encoded to numerical values to prepare the data for machine learning model training.

# 9. Outlier Handling
Outliers in the dataset are identified and addressed to prevent them from affecting model performance.

# 10. Model Building
A machine learning model for predicting booking cancellations is built using scikit-learn. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

# 11. Cross-Validation
The model is cross-validated to ensure its robustness and generalization to new data.

# 12. Comparison of Multiple Algorithms
Different machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, are explored to identify the most effective model for this dataset.

# 13. Feature Importance Analysis
Feature importance is analyzed to identify which features contribute most to the model's predictions.

# 14. GitHub Repository Structure
The GitHub repository is organized with clear folders for data, code, and documentation. The README file provides detailed information on the project, its goals, and the steps taken to achieve them. The code is well-documented, making it easy for others to understand and replicate the analysis.

# 15. Conclusion
The project concludes with a summary of findings and insights gained from the analysis. Suggestions for future improvements or additional analyses may also be included.
